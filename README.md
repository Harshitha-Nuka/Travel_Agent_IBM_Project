TRAVEL_AGENT - IBM CAPSTONE PROJECT

Developed by: Harshitha Nuka

Institution: Kakatiya University, Master of Computer Applications

Project Overview :

The Travel  Agent is an AI-powered travel planning solution that helps users plan their trips seamlessly by leveraging IBM Cloud and Watsonx AI technologies. It provides intelligent travel suggestions, builds itineraries, optimizes routes, and adapts plans in real time based on live data.

Problem Statement:

Build an AI-powered Travel  Agent that:

->Suggests destinations based on user preferences.

->Builds itineraries and recommends transportation and accommodations.

->Uses real-time data (weather, events, traffic).

->Manages bookings and sends alerts.

->Dynamically adjusts the travel schedule.

Technologies Used:

->IBM Watsonx AI Studio

->IBM Granite Foundation Model

->IBM Cloud Agent Lab

->IBM Cloud Functions (serverless)

->IBM Object Storage

->Natural Language Processing (NLP)

->Large Language Models (LLMs)

Wow Factors:

->Real-time itinerary updates based on live weather and travel updates

->Personalized suggestions using IBM Granite NLP

->Tailored recommendations based on user interests, budget, and duration

->Integrated maps, weather, and booking info for smooth planning

->Chat-based interaction with Watson Assistant

->Efficient serverless logic using IBM Cloud Functions

End Users:

->Individual travelers

->Travel bloggers and influencers

->Business travelers (multi-city trips)

->Academic/research travelers
